<p>This site contains very basic coding skills, infact some images might be missing due to errors in uploading. However, this website clearly took 
    a lot of effort as you can see from the details pertaining to the sites sides, heading, and footer. Lots of color and nice pictures for those with more advantced olfactory sensors.
