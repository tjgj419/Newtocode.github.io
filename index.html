    <h3>Introductions(!)</h3>
<p>While I do not know the plan for this site just yet, I would much rather learn more and have more of an understanding <br> of codinng
    so that I can utlize it more and then theme it after. However, deciding that theme will be challenging as I would like <br> to theme it about
    everything I've learned in coding but I have almost no background in it. So I have no real idea the limits of what will <br> be able to be
    done in terms of how personalized I can make the webpage. I wouldn't mind personalizing it to the best of my ability. </p>
