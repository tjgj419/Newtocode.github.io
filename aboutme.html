Some things about me is I've never actually taken any sort of programming class and only<br>
recently started getting into computer related hobbies. I'm quite a fan of rugby and have<br>
played it for around two and a half seasons, half a season here at uri I just can't juggle<br>
school and sports. Additionally, I'm really interested in building computers and other<br> tech.
I built my own desktop a couple years ago and have rebuilt it twice so far just to<br> make it look
and feel better performance wise. I'm quite proud of it essentially and I only want<br> to make it
Better. Learning how to code is definintly going to help me. I'm also a Marine<br> Biology major
who's interested in getting a cs minor.
