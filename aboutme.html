<p id="description">

Some things about me is I've never actually taken any sort of programming class and only<br>
recently started getting into computer related hobbies. I'm quite a fan of rugby and have<br>
played it for around two and a half seasons, half a season here at uri I just can't juggle<br>
school and sports. Additionally, I'm really interested in building computers and other tech.<br>
I built my own desktop a couple years ago and have rebuilt it twice so far just to make it look<br>
and feel better performance wise. I'm quite proud of it essentially and I only wanna make it<br>
Better. Learning how to code is definintly going to help me. I'm also a Marine Biology major<br>
who's interested in getting a cs minor.
