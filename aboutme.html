      <h1>About Me</h1>
Some things about me is I've never actually taken any sort of programming class and only<br>
recently started getting into computer related hobbies. I'm quite a fan of rugby and have<br>
played it for around two and a half seasons, half a season here at uri I just can't juggle<br>
school and sports. Additionally, I'm really interested in building computers and other<br> tech.
I built my own desktop a couple years ago and have rebuilt it twice so far just to<br> make it look
and feel better performance wise. I'm quite proud of it essentially and I only<br> want to make it
Better. Learning how to code is definintly going to help me. I'm also a Marine<br> Biology major
who's interested in getting a cs minor.

<p>
Rugby isn't the only sport i've done, I've participated in crew for around a year and a half <br>
as a coxswain, the driver and commander of the boat. Didn't enjoy it that much as a "sport"<br>
because I physically wasn't moving that much just yelling at others to work hard.<br>
So now i've moved to rugby which has given me way more fun and enjoyment than crew.<br>
Would reccomend trying rugby one day, it's a load of fun especailly when you know<br>
how to play safely.
