    <h2>Description of Applications</h2>
<p>Now apps? That's something i'm quite interested in, I think there's <em> something </em> to be had there. <br>As there's
  so many things that can be done and made into an app weather it be entertainment, education, or even finance. <br>An app that can help
  someone finace themselves while also throwing all their personal information like social secruity number, mother's maiden
  name,<br> and even the last four digits of your credit card, with the three on the back. Ah capitalism.
