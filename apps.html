<p>Now apps? That's something i'm quite interested in, I think there's <em> something </em> to be had there. As there's
  so many things that can be done and made into an app weather it be entertainment, education, or even finance. An app that can help
  someone finace themselves while also throwing all their personal information like social secruity number, mother's maiden
  name, and even the last four digits of your credit card, with the three on the back. Ah capitalism.
